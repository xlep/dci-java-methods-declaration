# Declaring methods
The goal of this exercise it to make you familiar with the different parts of method declarations.

* Create a method that prints the String "Hello World!"
* Create a method that takes a name (as a string) and prints a greeting using that name (e.g. "Good Morning Thomas") 
* Create a method that takes any sentence and replaces all occurrences of the space-symbol " " with an underscore "_" and passes the changed String back to the caller.
  * Optional:  Check each letter with your own logic instead of using a method like String.replaceAll().
